Description: SCINA (Single-cell EM model-based NGS sorting algorithm), a cell type detection and automatically assignment algorithm for single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-seq) and Cytof/FACS data. SCINA is capable of taking pre-established cell types with transcriptome biomarker genes to assign each cell a unique cell type and/or defining cell types and gene signatures with pre-labeled RNA expression matrix.
